# Magic Square
This is a Python sample that uses PyAutoGUI and OpenCV to draw a 4x4 magic square in MS Paint. This project was tested on Windows 10.

## Install required libraries

### PyAutoGUI
`pip install pyautogui`

### OpenCV
`pip install opencv-python`

The program asks for some input and displays some additional instructions through pop-up windows. Just be sure to have
MS Paint open in a maximized window and without the status bar enabled as shown here:

If you already have the latest version of Python and the required libraries installed, run the script with the following command:

`python Square.py`

Make sure to have the Square.py script in the same directory as the Images folder.
